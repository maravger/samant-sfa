  # GENI API Credentials
  #
  # The privileges are the rights that are assigned to the owner
  # of the credential on the target resource. Different slice
  # authorities use different permission names, but they have
  # similar semantic meaning.  If and only if a privilege can
  # be delegated, then that means the owner of the credential
  # can delegate that permission to another entity.
  # Currently, the only credentials used in the GENI API are
  # slice credentials and user credentials.  Privileges have not
  # yet been agreed upon between the control frameworks.
  # Currently, SFA assigns ['refresh', 'resolve', and 'info']
  # rights to user credentials.
  # Slice credentials have "slice" rights. ProtoGENI defaults
  # to the "*" privilege which means that the owner has rights
  # to all methods associated with that credential type
  # (user or slice).
  # See https://www.protogeni.net/trac/protogeni/wiki/ReferenceImplementationPrivileges
  # for more information on ProtoGENI privileges.
